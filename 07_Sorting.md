# # Sorting in Java

-  Arranging elements of an array or a collection in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.
-   Tt reduces the complexity of a problem.

## # Types of Sorting

The following two types of sorting algorithms can be broadly classified:

**1. `Comparison-based`** : We compare the elements in a comparison-based sorting algorithm.  
**2. `Non-comparison-based`** : We do not compare the elements in a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm.

# # Bubble Sort Algorithm

- Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.
